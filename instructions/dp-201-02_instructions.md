# DP 201 - Designing an Azure Data Platform Solution.

# Lab 2 - Azure Batch Processing Reference Architectures.

**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read.

**Lab files**: The files for this lab are located in the _Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.2_ folder.

## Lab overview

The students will use the case study to identify which business and technical requirements relate to a Lambda architecture from a batch mode perspective. The student will then architect an enterprise BI solution, and then add automation to the architecture. Finally, the students will attempt to design an AI architecture that focuses on the data stores that would be required to support such a solution

## Lab objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Design an Enterprise BI solution in Azure
2. Automate enterprise BI solutions in Azure
3. Architect an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure

## Scenario

You are the senior data engineer of AdventureWorks. You are designing and architecting a solution that will deal with the batch mode processing of data. You have been advised that the solution architecture should take a holistic view of all the business requirements and your proposal should be presented in a Word document.

You will first define which aspect of the AdventureWorks requirements fits into batch mode processing of a Lambda architecture. You will then provide an architecture for an enterprise BI solution in Azure and think of ways that the solution can be automated. You will also design a first pass on an AI architecture.

At the end of this lab, you will have:

1. Design an Enterprise BI solution in Azure
2. Automate enterprise BI solutions in Azure
3. Architect an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure

> **Note**: This lab is in two parts. This is part 1 where you work as a group to answer the questions. The timings of each exercise is at the discretion of the group. The entire lab should be completed within 60 minutes. In Part 2, the instructor will drive a discussion with the group about their learnings and findings about the Lab.

> **Resources**: As well as the using the course case study for this lab, you use also use resources such a [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com), the [Azure Reference Architecture Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/) and the [Microsoft Customer Stories Site](https://customers.microsoft.com/) to help inform you in answering questions in this lab.

## Exercise 1: Design an Enterprise BI solution in Azure

**Group exercise**

The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. From the case study, identify the requirements that would form part of the Batch mode processing of data in an Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

1. Build a high level Architecture that reflects the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: List batch mode processing requirements for AdventureWorks

1. From your machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-201-Lab02_Ex01_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.2** folder.

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** discussing and listing the requirements that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks. Evidence should be provided from the case study.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created a Microsoft Word document that shows a table of security requirements for AdventureWorks.

### Task 2: Build a high level Architecture that reflects the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

1. From your machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-201-Lab01_Ex01_Ta02.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.2** folder.

1. As a group, spend **20 minutes** discussing and diagraming the architectures that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks. You can use the png files in the icon folder to build your architecture.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created architectures that would form part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 2: Automate enterprise BI solutions in Azure

**Group exercise**

The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. Amend a high level Architecture to include automation of an Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: Amend a high level architecture to include automation of an Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

1. From your machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-201-Lab01_Ex02_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.2** folder. Read the document and review the example.

1. As a group, spend **15 minutes** reviewing the architectures that you have defined as part of the Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks in the document **DP-201-Lab01_Ex01_Ta02.docx**. Add the Data Factory icon to the workflows that would be automated by Data Factory. You can use the png files in the icon folder to build your architecture.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have amended an architecture to include automation of an Enterprise BI solution in AdventureWorks.

## Exercise 3: Conversational bot solutions in Azure

**Group exercise**

The main task for this exercise is as follows:

1. Amend a high level Architecture to include automation of a conversational bot solution in AdventureWorks.

### Task 1: Architect an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure

1. From your machine, start **Microsoft Word**, and open up the file **DP-201-Lab01_Ex03_Ta01.docx** from the **Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-201.2** folder. Read the document and review the example.

1. As a group, spend **10 minutes** discussing and diagraming the architectures that would form part of an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in AdventureWorks. You can use the png files in the icon folder to build your architecture.

> **Hint**: Only a simple architecture that deals with bot conversations is required

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an architecture to include an Enterprise-grade conversational bot in Azure.

## Lab Review

After approximately 60 minutes, the instructor will bring a close to this lab. The class will discuss the findings of each group.
